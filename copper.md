# Copper
Copper is the basic material for creating pipelines. It helps to run local actions with docker.

Copper offers three basic services
- MQTT broker to manage services end points
- fetcher executes fetch actions such as retrieve repos from github
- runner bootstraps execution of actions from a yaml workflow file

# Simple Usage
see this example repo for how to use copper in a light weight mode with a docker compose file and a workflow file

https://github.com/HomeSmartMesh/website_light/tree/main


# Dev usage
In this repo, copper is cloned as a submodule for development purpose

# Workflow
A workflow is a list of actions, where each has an `action` field. This field represents the MQTT topic on which the service endpoint is provided.
* A runner service will publish each action entry on its topic to trigger it
* it will then await the finish topic e.g. `fetcher/fetch/finish`
* Then continue with the next entry

```yaml
- action: fetcher/fetch
  type: github
  repository: MicroWebStacks/astro-big-doc
  ref: main
  filter: content/*
  resource: test-website
- action: markdown/build
  resource: test-website
  path: /fetch/test-website/content
```

# Concept

## service structure
a service consists of
* a docker container as a Dockerfile or folder
* an mqtt client to manage services and events
* optionally for bootstrapping a MANIFEST environemnt variable can be passed to use a local file

## broker API
* Services lifecycle management
    * start and stop a service
    * Lambda single shot a service for a single request
* Requests
    * subscribe to offer a service
    * publish to trigger
    * publish status and completion
* Resources
    * subscribe to consume
    * publish to produce

## content locations
* a core service within copper
* a local repo service
* a remote url service

## visualization
* collection of mosquitto logs allows to trace services publish and subscribe to generate a dependencies graph

## Events vs REST
two types of corss services interactions will be used :
* Event based
    * suitable for long running jobs
    * single instance
    * central MQTT broker

    A slow interaction is an an operation that
    * can require a long time to process such as more than 30s or minutes or hours.
    * is only initiated by a single service client
    * requests do not need to be queued
    * is needed sporadically or scheduled with jobs which period is necessarily bigger if not significantly bigger than the time it takes them to complete

* REST API
    * suitable for fast running jobs
    * multiple instances of independent clients
    * http REST API

    A fast interaction is an an operation that
    * completes necessarily within less any default request timeout config
    * can be initiated by any number of independent clients
    * requests need to be queued
    * is needed very frequently such as converting a high number of files

## docker in docker
as alternative to wrapping everything in a service API call, it is possible to execute docker commands from within docker with the Docker-in-Docker approach. This requires mounting the docker socket to communicate with the daemon.

# TODOs
* remove PyYaml could not isntall on windows and dependabot alert
* make filter optional and support glob variant
